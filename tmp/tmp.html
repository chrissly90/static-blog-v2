<p>This documentary includes most that you will never hear from Mass Media and that you should know about. So to speak it's an explanation why wars happen, why religion is nowadays a Business and so on. Zeitgeist the Movie was ment as a publication for <strong><a href="#venus">The Venus Project</a></strong> Zeitgeist has most of it's ideas from it. But not all. Neitherless I find it's a great piece of work. If you want to find the Man behind <strong>most</strong> of the ideas and I find it's the far greater ones then visit</p>
<p>For more information please visit https://www.thevenusproject.com/ and don't donate to Zeitgeist, instead donate to the Venus Project. The mind behind it all is still alive and can answer questions so it would be a shame if <strong>the work of his life</strong> would get no reputation because the Zeitgeist Movement steals his ideas</p>
