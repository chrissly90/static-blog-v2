[Nitter](https://nitter.net/) is a free and open source alternative Twitter front-end focused on privacy. The source is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/zedeus/nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter)

    - No JavaScript or ads
    - All requests go through the backend, clients never talk to Twitter
    - Prevents Twitter from tracking your IP or JavaScript fingerprint
    - Uses unofficial API (no developer account required)
    - AGPLv3 licensed, no proprietary instances permitted
    - Lightweight (for @nim_lang, 36KB vs 580KB from twitter.com)
    - Native RSS feeds

Nitter's GitHub wiki contains a list of [instances](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Instances) and a list of [browser extensions](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/wiki/Extensions) maintained by the community.
