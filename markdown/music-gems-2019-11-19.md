### Lyrics

Had no vision no place no mission
No religion, muslim or christian
Had no love we had no hate
Had no heart, we had no date

Had to be wrong to make it right
Had to be strong to start a fight
Fought for the bad, fought for the good
aslong as we stood we did what we could

went trough it all, heaven or hell
all that we knew that seconds would tell
if were bout to reach it loud
if the time is right now

while bullets are flying, people are dying
people denying, tellin "you're lying"
We keep hoping, keep on trying
with our fists we keep supplying

Scream it out loud

Scream it out loud X2
Sound of the written, the sound of the truth
the sound of a bomb hitting the news
nothing like us, nothing compared

with nothing that's something you find everywhere
were one a kind, straight for your mind
for those who blind, we the best you find
we came, we saw, we conquered it all

the problem solved? we made the call
in it to win it got in cuz we bring it
aint playing shows you know that we kill it
the words are spoken, music is power

who you think is gonna be louder?
while bullets are flying, people are dying
people denying, tellin "you're lying"
We keep hoping, keep on trying

with our fists we keep supplying
Scream it out loud
Scream it out loud X4
bullets flying
cuz people dying
people denying
cuz you lying
keep hoping
keep trying'
keep supplying
CHOP!
Scream it out loud
Scream it out loud
