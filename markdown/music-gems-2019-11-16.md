One bites oneself, especially when the way is not always easy.
The enemy yourself, your weakness an enemy image
The preparation foresight, your body a sign
For the fights to come and for no one to get you down.
Only all alone can you defeat the demons.
They're holding one, because they live in the slipstream.
The fear of losing a good motivation
And the voices screaming when you fall "Get your ass back up!"
And also on the most fucked up day of my life
Makes martial arts out of me the best version yet
Excuses don't count, you can't give up.
Not for nothing does it say that where a will is always a way.
Concentrate, focus target
Inhale, exhale, compress force
Increase the value of your anatomy
And burn the weakness, the weakness within you.
We prove heart, win with pride
Lose with respect, but never give up
We break through the boundaries, the road to legend.
Means fighting, even if no one believes in you.
Prove heart, win with pride
Lose with respect, but never give up
We break through the boundaries, the road to legend.
Means fighting, even if no one believes in you.
We go from unit to unit.
For if you want peace, my friend, you must always be ready for war.
Always give everything, but certainly never small at
To me, "breaking down barriers" means freedom.
Losing no problem, fighting spirit is what counts
Scars show no weakness, only that you're still standing.
Success is a staircase, every step you have to go
Because happiness is for people who don't have stamina.
I'm aware of strength, but don't shout it out
I'd rather be underestimated than a mouth too big.
For only when it hurts, when you fall
Then the wheat separates from the chaff
Only the winners stand up again
Concentrate, focus target
Inhale, exhale, compress force
Increase the value of your anatomy
And burn the weakness, the weakness within you.
We prove heart, win with pride
Lose with respect, but never give up
We break through the boundaries, the road to legend.
Means fighting, even if no one believes in you.
Prove heart, win with pride
Lose with respect, but never give up
We break through the boundaries, the road to legend.
Means fighting, even if no one believes in you.
Every shitty day just a good teacher
The heart of a V8 engine when ambition grabs you
Discipline comes when you motivate yourself.
And never loses sight of the goal
We prove heart, win with pride
Lose with respect, but never give up
We break through the boundaries, the road to legend.
Means fighting, even if no one believes in you.
Prove heart, win with pride
Lose with respect, but never give up
We break through the boundaries, the road to legend.
Means fighting, even if no one believes in you.
