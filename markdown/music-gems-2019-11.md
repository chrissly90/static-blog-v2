### Lyrics:

sex offenders, animal abusers, aggressive stepfathers
Nobody who says anything, but the blue eyes everyone sees
Just normal things, here in the city of sin.
An endless deep free fall into human abysses
Your God is money, his prophet is profit.
But a brother becomes Judas when he sees too much of it.
I've seen it, a friend lies to your face.
Because he's starting to get drug or a gambling addict.
And I wish with all my heart to be in my sister's class. 
Would kids come with a smile instead of a knife
If they never knew anything else, some don't know any better
But those who make it happen are the criminals.
Between all the rules and prohibitions they set up.
You may have no choice but to take the risk.
On a big scale out there, you can deal drugs and rob people.
But you'll never be as gangster as the top 10,000.

In Babylon City.
Doesn't matter what you believe in
You won't get any more community service at the doomsday court!
Wayo!
I can't put the whole drama into words
God is my witness - but is never summoned (Wayo)
Where no marriage lasts
With every argument - most of all with yourself
(Wayo-oho)
And I lose myself in the worries
I didn't understand Jesus - I never would have died for you!

Live in Babylon, Captured a Bob Marley song
My hatred fits easily into an entire stadium
The kids from the train station zoo have finally grown up.
But he fixed himself up right in front of us and drank himself to death.
Sure, there's no real slums around here.
Still kids sniffing deodorant to comfort their souls.
Silver-grey rainbows - no politicians come from here
Also none of the scene greats really lives here
All the things you don't know here from your village.
Wallflowers are stranded here and wither immediately
This city has no sea - you have to surf the subway here.
I never wanted to be part of it.
Look, in my town, parties sometimes last seventy-two hours.
But no one has found time for remorse or doubt.
Nobody believes in anything good here, because we came from the bottom.
And know how hard it is to use a scale without it.

In Babylon City.
Doesn't matter what you believe in
You won't get any more community service at Doomsday!
Wayo!
I can't put the whole drama into words
God is my witness - but is never summoned (Wayo)
Where no marriage lasts
With every argument - most of all with yourself
(Wayo-oho)
And I lose myself in the worries
I didn't understand Jesus - I never would have died for you!
