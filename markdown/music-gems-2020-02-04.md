<pre>
Nine hours passed
And how long will it last
Says the man with the plan
And a gun in his hand

He's scared but prepared
It might be as he feared
Are they still in control
And safe behind the wall?

This evening's too quiet
Oh, we need a real riot
To shake and to break
And to bite like a snake

We're stuck in this attic
So bored and so static
Tomorrow they'll ask us
To throw off our masks

But the storm is a-coming
'Cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts
That should fight

The storm is a-coming
'Cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts
That should fight

Hey

Mary's like me
She's a loser to be
Got a lock on her door
And a bed on the floor

You will know, they will win
And then they'll come in
There's nothing you could say
To lead them astray

We still live in silence
Like sworn threats of violence
I long for an end
And it's coming round the bend

If we live through this night
And we'll still be alright
We'd flee to Siam
Or a bar in Amsterdam

But the storm is a-coming
'Cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts
That should fight

The storm is a-coming
'Cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts
That should fight

The storm is a-coming
'Cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts
That should fight

The storm is a-coming
'Cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts

Yeah, the storm is a-coming
'Cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts
That should fight

The storm is a-coming
'Cross the hills tonight
Like a vein full of rain to the hearts
That should fight
