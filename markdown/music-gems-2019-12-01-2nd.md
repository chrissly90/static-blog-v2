Hey!

In my blood, running through my veins  
Wear it in my heart, inherited from my father.  
In the air I breathe, the way I focus things.  
My targets are the hunted, instinct makes you unbeatable.  

On the lookout like a panther, eyes eye every landscape  
This aura like a tank, I don't trust a handshake.  
The voice that warns me repeats itself like a mantra  
False promises are heroin, they distract the mind.  
Thinking is slowed down  
And the prey becomes more predictable when you hunters feel what they're afraid of.  
Every scar we wear makes the skin just a little thicker.  
And what was a cut back then won't even be a scratch today.  
Good face, bad play, we'll look at the scenery.  
So believe me, my friend, because there's only one thing you need to know.  
The feeling that crawls up your back like a shiver  
Is a hint of your instinct to protect you  

Where the eyes can't see  
You lack faith  
Trust does not count  
That only leaves you with your instincts.  
Trust him blindly!  
Where the eyes can't see  
You lack faith  
Trust does not count  
That only leaves you with your instincts.  
If you have only your instinct  
I follow him blindly  

In my blood, running through my veins  
Wear it in my heart, inherited from my father.  
In the air I breathe, the way I focus things.  
My targets are the hunted, instinct makes you unbeatable.  

Always present, because nobody has made him  
Strengthened like a plant whose roots were in the asphalt  
And my gaze, it cuts through the gray-black veil  
Because they lure you with poison, purple bills or women  
Know the jungle like a boy who's lived there since he was a kid.  
Like a blacksmith who never pauses, he makes my will iron.  
Sharpen the blade that cuts through false shackles made by the hype  
Every soul is x-rayed and sees whether it was pure or not.  
I give him a hundred percent he'll add to that for the team.  
He wants peace at all costs, but forms me for war.  
Like a fabric that grows and motivates my muscles  
A hypocrite's immune system attacks the parasite.  
A profiler who sees from a voice pitch  
Whether she's lying when she says she loves you.  
But also the love goes by, because every ship sinks sometime  
But what I end up with is instinct.  

Where the eyes can't see  
You lack faith  
Trust does not count  
That only leaves you with your instincts.  
Trust him blindly!  
Where the eyes can't see  
You lack faith  
Trust does not count  
That only leaves you with your instincts.  
If you have only your instinct  
I follow him blindly
