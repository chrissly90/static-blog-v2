Do not forget that your Browser is your main weak point, when it comes to security on your Desktop OS! So securing it is the best way to protect yourself. Also a mistake made by many users is, that they blindly install every Browser Addon, which often got on the one hand a good rating but is on the other hand a privacy mess, since many Addons can view and send your whole browsing history and activity to foreign servers. Keep that in mind...
